I am writing this because I am feeling lonely due to a specific reason. 
I am not writing this here instead of diary because I want to share it with someone. 
I don't expect anyone to read it. But atleast there is a non-zero probability of someone reading it.

I am feeling lonely. I am not actually lonely. I have loving parents, a nice housemate and a few good friends. 
Parents can't understand every feelings I am experiencing. 
The good friends which were once family, have become acquaintances in past one and half year.
I have just moved a week ago with my housemate, so I can't share my feelings with her.
I am making new friends and there is a good progress but deep bonds are not maggie which would be ready in 2 minutes.
I know it would take time and I am ready to be patient. It is just that I am feeling lonely at the moment.
The last one week passed in a rush with all the shifting, paperwork, orientation etc.
And now that the rush is over and I finally have time to think, I am feeling this void.
My IIT house used to feel home because I had my 2nd family there but this house doesn't feel home.
I don't want to be in my room.
At present I am just trying to distract myself with work.
