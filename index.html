Historically it was assumed that all stars began their life made from hydrogen, with heavier
elements being generated via nuclear fusion reactions as they burned. While this is certainly
the process giving rise to the heavy elements, it was eventually recognized that all the light
elements — deuterium, helium-3, lithium and especially helium-4 — could not have been
created. in this manner. Instead, as one looks to younger and younger stars, these approach
nonzero abundances, which the stars seem to begin their lives with. These abundances are
apparently those of the primordial gas from which the stars formed.

Typical nuclear binding energy is around 1 MeV, and so if typical photon energies exceed this,
then nuclei will be immediately dissociated. This energy is about 100 000 times greater than the
electron binding energy, and so the corresponding temperature is higher by this factor. The
formation of nuclei in the Universe therefore took place at a much earlier stage in the
Universe's history; when the Universe was about one second old. The process is known as
nucleosynthesis.<br>
