Space is the vast, dark, and mysterious place beyond our planet Earth. Space is where the stars, planets, and galaxies are located.

Our solar system is like a family of planets; the Sun is at the center. There are eight main planets in our solar system, including Earth:

What do you know about the moon?
<br> It is our closest neighbor in space. It's the only place, other than Earth, where humans have walked. Neil Armstrong is the first person on the Moon. 
<br> The moon does not have its own light. We see it because of the reflected sunlight. Associated phenomena are the phases of the moon, solar eclipse, and lunar eclipse.
<br> It takes the moon 27 days to complete an orbit around Earth. While our calendar is based on our revolution around the sun, many cultures use the moon's phases to count days and years. Indian festivals are based on the lunar calendar. We only see one side of the moon. 
<br> Moon has no atmosphere. So, you would not talk there, and if you don’t wear space suits, you would die by bursting. It has only 1/6th of Earth’s gravity. We can jump really high.

What else do we have besides the Sun and planets in the Solar System?
<br> We have comets, meteorites, and asteroids. Comets come from <b>Kupler belt</b>. 
<br> Kuiper Belt (ky-purr) is a flat ring of millions of small, icy objects just outside of Neptune’s orbit. This is where you’ll find dwarf planet Pluto. These objects orbit the Sun at a very great distance. They are mostly 30 to 50 times farther from the Sun than Earth is. They take less than 200 years to orbit the Sun. 
<br> At the solar system's outer reaches is the Oort Cloud. It is a massive cloud of countless small, icy objects. The Oort Cloud surrounds the rest of the solar system. It is about 50 times farther from the Sun than the Kuiper Belt. The comet with the most extended known orbit takes over 250,000 years to make just one trip around the Sun!
